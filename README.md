# TheWeeklyPoetryProject
A website that allows weekly poetry contests, where the public can submit weekly and get good turnaround at no charge because of automated functions. For fun, basically.

All poems are received and scored by a series of factors, having a trained small language model that is able to use prior scoring from myself to choose the poems to go onto human scoring (top 50) in a fast way. Winner is chosen on criteria that an SLM might have trouble understanding.

This isn't high stakes, just a fun thing to get people engaged. I will have to set a strict, and ironic, quick check for AI use on each of the submissions that will cause disqualification if AI is suspected by a trained model.

Give it a try:
